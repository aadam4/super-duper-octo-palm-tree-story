My name is Yijun Cheng, this is my story. I am writing this story for xteam3 assignment. It is difficult!

Hi Yijun! My name is Jack and I am adding to your story. You are right, this assignment is difficult! I think we are learning valuable lessons about using github though. 

Hi yall! I'm Shlok and I hate Github.
I also think Github hates me!

Hello everyone! My name is Ali and I am wrapping up this story. GitHub was a difficult to learn how to use at first
but, now I am starting to get the hang of it just like everyone else! This can be great for team projects 
where we have to work together! Hooray!
